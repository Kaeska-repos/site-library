# site-library
This repository was created to store a website that will demonstrate my work using the Django framework.

At the moment, the main page of the site displays only a list of registered books (the list items are links).
The page contains a search form by title and author.
Clicking on the link opens a page with a more detailed description of the book.
Books are registered using the admin panel. Superuser login: "super", password: "12345".
