# site-library
This repository was created to store a website that will demonstrate my work using the Django framework.

The site conditionally belongs to a library containing paper books.
At the moment, the main page of the site displays only a list of registered books (the list items are links).
Books that are currently in the readers possession are marked "out of stock".
The page contains a search form by title and author.
Clicking on the link opens a page with a more detailed description of the book.
Books, readers, the date when the book was given to the reader, they are all registered using the admin panel.
